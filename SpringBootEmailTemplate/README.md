### Other information

If you want to try with your personal Gmail account you need to do some steps:
1. Login to the gmail account you are sending mail from.
2. Go to Manage your Google Account -> Security -> Less secure app access -> Turn on access (not recommended).
3. Turn "Allow less secure apps: OFF" to "Allow less secure apps: ON".
4. Then, after you test the project I recommend to set OFF again this property on your Google account.

Thank you.
