This repository it's for sprint-boot projects

## Information

Hi all
  
My name is Jose Pablo Solano and I want to show/help you to see how you can do several things with spring-boot. I will give you some examples.

## Requirements

* Java 8 or higher
* Maven
* IDE (Intellij, Eclipse, etc)

## Project Examples

[Spring Boot + Email template with Thymeleaf](https://github.com/pabloso18/spring-boot-projects/tree/master/SpringBootEmailTemplate) 

This example it's to send an email using Spring boot 2 + gmail SMTP + Thymeleaf HTML template with an attachment. Also we will use Lombok.

[Spring Boot + Hateoas](https://github.com/pabloso18/spring-boot-projects/tree/master/SpringHateoasDemo)

On this example, I will show you how to add HATEOAS links to existing REST APIs with H2 Database.
